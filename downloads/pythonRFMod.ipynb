    "This code introduces the use of a [RF (Resource Finder) module](http://www.yarp.it/classyarp_1_1os_1_1RFModule.html). It contains two loops that run simultaneously; one runs a method *updateModule* at intervals defined in the method *time*. The other works via a specialised port called a [RPC port](http://www.yarp.it/rpc_ports.html). A RPC port can send commands to the RF module, and request a response back. This response is defined in the method *respond*, the contents of which is run only when a command is sent through the RPC port. The *configure* method contains information and functions necessary for initialising the module; it is run once at the beginning.|\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to demonstrate its use, the task from the previous exercise is redone here using the properties of the RF module. Functionality is added by writing to the */read* port only with the command **print** is sent from the RPC port. \n",
